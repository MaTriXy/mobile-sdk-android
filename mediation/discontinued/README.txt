discontinued folder contains adapters that are no longer actively maintained or supported

We saw little to no usage for some of the mediation adapters that are included in the Mobile SDK. We will NOT be actively maintaining or supporting the adapters in the list (see below) from the SDKv7.7 release onwards.

Amazon
InMobi
Millennial Media
Mopub
Facebook

We will stop uploading them to Maven.

These Adapters will be removed in SDK v8.0

If you have any questions/comments please let us know either via GitHub/or via Xandr Support.
