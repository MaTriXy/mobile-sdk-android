Appnexus Android SDK
==================

> [!CAUTION]  
> We no longer release source code updates of Android SDK to Github. This is not a deprecation of our SDK, only an open-source deprecation as we are taking our Android and iOS Mobile SDKs private.  
> Future updates starting from SDK v9.0 will be released only as compiled .aar binary file and will be published via MavenCentral or another equivalent service.  
> Please contact your account managers or submit a ticket via the Customer Support Portal: https://help.xandr.com/ if you have any questions.
